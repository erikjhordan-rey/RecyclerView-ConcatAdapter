## Sample

**LinearLayoutManager (Vertical)**

<img src="./art/Screenshot.png" width="220">

```xml

    <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
        ...
        app:spanCount="2"
        app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.GridLayoutManager"/>

```

 
Try adding horizontal orientation `android:orientation="horizontal"` to GridLayoutManager or LinearLayoutManager.
